I am excited to share that today I successfully defended my oral PhD dissertation titled "Solving Poisson Inverse Problems in Phase Retrieval and Single Photon Emission Computerized Tomography". I would like to express my deep gratitude to my advisors, Professor Jeff Fessler and Professor Yuni Dewaraja, whose expertise, support, and guidance were invaluable throughout my entire PhD journey. I would also like to acknowledge the contribution of my research collaborators whose participations were very essential to the quality of my research. I am truly grateful for all the support and guidance I have received, as without it, this thesis would not have been possible.

I am truly grateful for all the support and guidance I have received, as without it, this thesis would not have been possible.

I would like to express my sincere gratitude and appreciation to all those who have supported me throughout this journey of completing my PhD thesis. Their unwavering support, encouragement, guidance, and valuable insights have played a significant role in the successful completion of this work.
Firstly, I extend my deepest thanks to my advisors Dr. Jeff Fessler and Dr. Yuni Dewaraja for their exceptional mentorship and invaluable expertise. Their continuous support and constructive criticism pushed me beyond my limits and helped shape the direction of this research. Their insightful comments, suggestions, and critiques significantly con- tributed to enhancing the quality of my research.
Furthermore, I would like to acknowledge University of Michigan for providing neces- sary resources including access to literature databases as well as laboratory facilities that were essential for conducting experiments outlined in this thesis.
In addition, I sincerely appreciate the cooperation received from fellow researchers from University of Michigan and other universities. The intellectual exchanges we shared during seminars or informal discussions greatly enriched both my knowledge base and research outcomes.
Finally, heartfelt thanks go out to my parents and friends harbored immense faith in me during challenging times - your emotional support kept me motivated when doubts loomed over progress.
