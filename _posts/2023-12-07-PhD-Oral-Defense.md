I am excited to share that today I successfully defended my oral PhD dissertation titled "Solving Poisson Inverse Problems in Phase Retrieval and Single Photon Emission Computerized Tomography". I would like to express my deep gratitude to my advisors, Professor Jeff Fessler and Professor Yuni Dewaraja, whose expertise, support, and guidance were invaluable throughout my entire PhD journey. I would also like to acknowledge the contribution of my research collaborators whose participations were very essential to the quality of my research. I am truly grateful for all the support and guidance I have received, as without it, this thesis would not have been possible.
