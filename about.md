Hi! My name is Zongyu Li. Currently I am an algorithm Engineer at KLA Corporation, developing AI and image processing algorithms for semiconductor defect inspection. I received PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering in 2024, MS in Computer Vision in 2021, both from University of Michigan. I did my undergrad in Huazhong University of Science and Technology from 2015 to 2019.

My PhD research is about medical image reconstruction, particularly in single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT). This is a challenging problem due to the low energy in gamma rays, collimator constraints, physical attenuation, scatters, motion artifacts, etc. However, we can utilize AI and deep learning to assist better reconstruction, attenuation correction, motion correction, noise reduction, by learning from existing patient data.
My PhD thesis is available at [DeepBlue](https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/handle/2027.42/193402);
with its recent update available at [Github](https://github.com/ZongyuLi-umich/ZongyuLi-umich.github.io/blob/master/ZL_PhD_update.pdf).
